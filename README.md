Cardboard ATM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C++ arduino code for the Cardboard_ATM I made using an Arduino Mega

The ATM supports depositing tokens, purchasing tokens, user statistics, and a token price that changes in value every once in a while, like company stocks.

The main part of this project is the machine itself, which is physical. Here is a (video)[https://todo.com] of the project working.

First big arduino project, 2nd C++ project.
